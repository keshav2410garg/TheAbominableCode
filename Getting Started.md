# Getting Started
Hope you are excited for what this round has to offer. Here's what you need to do. 

You have done well so far and this round is personalized for yout. Kudos! You would have notied that there are subfolders in this repository after your name. 
Navigate to the folder by your name. You will find some files which are uniquely relvant to you for this round. This round will be in three parts. Here's the breakdown. 

## Part 1 - Find the Broken Code
* You are given a cloud hosted unique mongo connection url in your dedicated subfolders.
* You need to connect to the url. Examine and query the collections to find out the most relevant collection. (Only one of the collectios holds data, rest are empty)
* Query the collection and you will get a link.
* This link is the link to the site which contains the Abominable code. You need to fix this code. 


## Part 2: Fix the Broken Code
* Once you reach the site, you will see a question on your screen. This question will be based on a common open source programming language.
* There are some errors in this questions. You need to fix there errors.
* Copy the question from the site, and choose your favourite IDE/Editor to debug it.


## Part 3: Push the Fixed Code
* You will notice that there is a file with name "SUBMISSION.[EXTENSION]" in your dedicated folder.
* Everyone playing this round has a unique question so the EXTENSIONS might vary as per the programming language you are given.
* Fork this repository to your github page and put the fixed code in the file "SUBMISSION.[EXTENSION]".
* Once done, send a upstream PR and you're done!!!

# Important Notes
* Everyone playing this round will have a unique question to debug so you can't really sneek peak to other's part. 
* In case you have never used Mongo before, there will be sufficient resources in the folder called "RESOURCES" to help you ace this round (and learn sufficient usage of Mongo)
* The question to be debugged will be conceptual in nature so it will be possible to solve it if you have graduation level programming experience.
